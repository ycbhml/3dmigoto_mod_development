V1.0.1.6
- Fix the vertex number increase problem when export .ib and .vb file from blender in our MMT plugin's v1.4.7 version,
now we can make perfect WuWa weight delete mod(to hide vertex by delete weight) ,or we can make vertex move mod also,
you will need to install latest V1.4.7 version of MMT's blender plugin to get this feature.

- Remove wrong game type for WuWa, now only WW_Body left there, and with MMT-Blender V1.4.7 it works perfectly good.

V1.0.1.5
- Add a game type WW_BodyType2 for WuWa,it's a correct type with TANGENT in it and can get per fect shadow,
 but use it will cause blender_3dmigoto plugin calculate more than original vertex number when export model to vb file,
so it's prepared for future if some one figure out how to solve the vertex number problem.

So why is WW_Body won't change vertex number? because it takes TANGENT value as COLOR,
so when blender export it , it will try to HashAble the vertex and COLOR only have one value on one point,
so a point will be generate to one point, but TANGENT have more thant one value on one point,
so a point with TANGENT will be generate to multiple point ,which will lead to vertex number increase。

- Use UE4's Coordinate space conversion with blender coordinate to Fix WuWa's NORMAL/TANGENT problem
now if you choose WW_BodyType2 to make mod, it will get a correct shadow because our NORMAL/TANGENT is correct,
but you will meet vertex number problem which will lead character's eye can't render correct, so there is still under testing and dev.

- Modified some code in latest MMT's blender's plugin to make sure it always export the correct vertex number , extra number vertex will be abandon.
Now use WW_BodyType2 and latest MMT's blender's plugin will solve part of the shadow not correct problem.
